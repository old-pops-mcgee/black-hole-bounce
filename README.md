# Black Hole Bounce
Stay on screen as long as you can, before the black holes suck you in!

This is an entry for the 21st Alakajam: https://alakajam.com/21st-alakajam

To play:
* Left and Right arrow keys turn your ship left and right
* Up arrow key accelerates your ship
* Down arrow key decelerates your ship

If your ship hits the edge of the screen, gets sucked into a black hole, or collides with an asteroid, it's game over!
